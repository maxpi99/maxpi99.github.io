I am a doctoral student at the Institute of Sociology and Social Psychology (ISS) at the University of Cologne.
My research interests include sociology, criminology, computational social sciences, natural language processing, and causal inference.
My dissertation explores the relationship between policing activities, police legitimacy, and juvenile delinquency.
Currently, I am employed in the project "Freundschaft und Gewalt im Jugendalter 2024" (Friendship and Violence in Adolescence 2024).
