I am a doctoral student at the Department of Sociology and Social Psychology (DSS) at the University of Cologne.
My research interests include sociology, criminology, computational social sciences, natural language processing, and causal inference.
My dissertation explores the relationship between policing activities, public perceptions of police legitimacy, and juvenile delinquency.
Currently, I am employed in the project Friendship and Violence in Adolescence [fugj-studie.de](https://fugj-studie.de/).
